2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_DB[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_DB[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_DB[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_DB[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_DB[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_DB[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_DB[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_DB[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on LCD_DB[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on LCD_DB[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on LCD_DB[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on LCD_DB[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on input relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LCD_E relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LCD_RS relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LCD_RW relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
